# Stats Run Report

## Local Review Safety Header

- This is a standard-table statistical run, not proof of causal effect or clinical validity.
- Interpret estimates with uncertainty, diagnostics, data quality, and study design context.
- P-values are reported as compatibility measures under a model; they are not effect sizes or practical importance.
- Binding status: unbound.
- Result posture: exploratory_standard_table (Exploratory standard-table result).
- Interpretation boundary: This run is not bound to a method-selection artifact or AnalysisSpec, so treat it as exploratory until governed by pre-run evidence.
- No complex survey design was declared for this standard-table run.

## Methods

- Method: gamma-glm
- Rows: 240
- Complete-case N: 240
- Variables: outcome_cont, treatment, age, severity
- Weight: (none)
- Supports: local data debugging; rough statistical exploration; candidate method smoke testing
- Cannot support: method-governed inference; paper-ready conclusions; causal claims
- Next action: Create or bind method-selection and AnalysisSpec evidence, then rerun before paper lifecycle promotion.
