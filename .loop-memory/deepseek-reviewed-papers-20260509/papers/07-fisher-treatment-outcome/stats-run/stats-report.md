## Local Review Safety Header

- This is a standard-table statistical run, not proof of causal effect or clinical validity.
- Interpret estimates with uncertainty, diagnostics, data quality, and study design context.
- P-values are reported as compatibility measures under a model; they are not effect sizes or practical importance.
- Binding status: bound.
- Result posture: bound_standard_table (Bound standard-table result).
- Interpretation boundary: This run is bound to method/spec evidence and can support local methods review for non-survey standard-table analyses.
- No complex survey design was declared for this standard-table run.
