# How well does the risk score discriminate the binary outcome

## Abstract

Background: This study analyzes a local research dataset to answer a declared clinical or public-health question.

Objective: How well does the risk score discriminate the binary outcome?

Design: This was a local prediction-modeling analysis with performance metrics interpreted as internal evidence.

Participants: The analyzed sample included 240 complete-case records.

Methods: The detected model family was prediction. The analysis used conservative claim language and was reviewed with deterministic methods checks.

Results: The complete-case analytic sample included 240 records.

Conclusion: The analysis produced interpretable local evidence, but methods review is required before stronger claims.

## Introduction

This analysis asks: How well does the risk score discriminate the binary outcome? The goal is to summarize a dataset-grounded association, prediction signal, diagnostic-performance estimate, or cohort outcome in a way that is reproducible and clear about its limits.

## Methods

### Study Design And Data Source

This was a local prediction-modeling analysis with performance metrics interpreted as internal evidence The report is based on local analysis artifacts in the run directory. It should be interpreted as a local research analysis unless an external validation or population-design correction is explicitly documented.

### Cohort Construction

The cohort definition was read from available run artifacts. The complete-case sample size was 240. Missingness, eligibility, and sparse-cell concerns are handled as review items rather than hidden implementation details.

### Variables

The primary outcome, exposure, and covariates were not fully encoded in the text report; review the companion variable artifact before external sharing.

### Statistical Analysis

The detected model family was prediction. Model diagnostics, missingness checks, semantic plausibility checks, and claim-alignment checks were reviewed before considering the result ready for promotion.

### Quality Control

The methods review found advisory issues that need human review. The analysis is not ready for stronger claims until the advisory methods issues are reviewed. Keep internal framework details in companion artifacts, not the manuscript.

## Results

- The complete-case analytic sample included 240 records.
- For pred_score, AUROC was 0.7451 and Brier score was 0.1925.

## Discussion

The result should be interpreted conservatively as local evidence from the analyzed dataset. These findings should be read as dataset-bound evidence, not as a clinical recommendation or causal proof unless the study design specifically supports that interpretation.

## Limitations

- The analysis is limited to the rows, variables, and eligibility rules represented in the run artifacts.
- Complete-case exclusion or missingness may affect the result if missingness is related to exposure, outcome, or covariates.
- Deterministic methods checks identified issues that require review before publication or external sharing.
- No reader-facing paper/manuscript artifact was found.
- No reader-facing report was available for claim alignment.

## What This Does And Does Not Show

- This report shows what the analyzed table or packet produced under the declared local methods.
- It does not establish causality unless a causal design, confounding plan, and sensitivity analysis were explicitly reviewed.
- It does not establish clinical deployability, external validity, or treatment recommendations.

## Reproducibility

The run directory contains 13 artifact(s). The artifact inventory hash is ee078ff1cac291bc9146a70a60fc60dfca69032116e0c1a314d43b00f1dcb6e8. Companion JSON files contain machine-readable provenance, QA checks, and run inspection data.
